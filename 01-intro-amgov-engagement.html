  <p>A <i>government</i> is the set of institutions and processes that decide
    and implement decisions on behalf of a particular <em>polity</em> (a
    given territory or people).</p>

  <p class="fragment">Within the United States, there are many levels
    of government that exercise authority over communities (such as
    cities and counties), states, and territories, as well as our
    national government.</p>

  <p>There is no single definition of <i>politics</i>, but two have

  <li class="fragment">20th century political scientist Harold

    ‚Äúthe authoritative allocation of values for a

  <p>Modern political scientists apply the methods of the <i>social
      sciences</i> to the systematic study of the theory and practice of
    politics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Political science's roots
      are <i>interdisciplinary</i>, encompassing philosophy, history,
      law, and economics.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Other contemporary social sciences include
      economics, geography, psychology, and sociology.</li>

  <p>Enlightenment-era philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke,
  and Jean-Jacques Rousseau had competing beliefs about society before
    (or without) government:</p>

  <ul>
  <img alt="The Cover of a 1750 edition of The Leviathan." src="img/intro/Ttitelblatt_1750_Leviathan_Thomas_Hobbs.jpg" style="float: right; width: 20%"/>
    <li class="fragment">Hobbes famously believed life for most people
      would be ‚Äúnasty, brutish, and short‚Äù until humans
      banded together to create governments to protect them from others.</li>

  <li class="fragment">Locke and Rousseau believed human nature was
    more peaceful and benevolent than Hobbes did, and that people did
    not give up their rights when they formed governments.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>The Social Contract</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/soccontract.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

<p>Regardless of why humans chose to form governments, all of
  the <i>social contract theorists</i> believed that people within a
  society have agreed to accept certain duties and responsibilities in
  exchange for their government doing the same.</p>

<p class="fragment">In our society, the primary obligation of the
  people is to obey the law. In return, our government protects our
  fundamental rights and liberties and provides <i>public
  goods</i>.</p>

  <h2>Capitalism and Socialism</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/capitalsocial.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Historically the development of <i>democracy</i> was linked
    with growth of <i>capitalism</i>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class=fragment><p>Economic system in which property, goods,
        and services are freely traded without control by
        governments.</li>
      <li class=fragment><p>Both reflect spirit
        of <i>individualism</i> from the Enlightenment era: Locke,
        Adam Smith.</li>
    </ul>

  <p class=fragment>In the 19th century, the competing idea
    of <i>socialism</i> was developed by Karl Marx, Eduard Bernstein,
    and others. Socialists believe the government, not private
    individuals, should control the economy.

  <p>Capitalism and democracy still tend to go together, but:

    <ul>
      <li class=fragment><p>Some non-democracies such as modern
        China, Nazi Germany (1933&ndash;45) have or had large private
        sectors (<i>state capitalism</i>).

      <li class=fragment><p>Most modern democracies have <i>mixed
        economies</i> that incorporate some aspects
        of <i>socialism</i>&mdash;including the United States. Some
        are <i>social democracies</i> like Sweden.

  <h2>Market Failure</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="14,18,21,24" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/marketfail.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/marketfail.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>In capitalist societies, government attempts to solve four major
    forms of <i>market failure</i>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Failure to provide <em>public goods</em>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Failure to account
      for <em>externalities</em>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Market power of <em>monopolies</em>.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Lack of <em>equity</em> in outcomes.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Failure to Provide Public Goods</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="12,22,23,25,28" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/pubgoods.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>

</audio>

  <img alt="Aerial view of The Pentagon." src="img/intro/640px-The_Pentagon_US_Department_of_Defense_building.jpg" style="float: right; width: 30%"/>

  <p><em>Public goods</em> are essential things needed by a
    society that would not be provided (or would not be provided
    enough) by a free market.</p>

  <p class="fragment"><b>Not everything that the government does is a
      public good!</b> Examples include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">National defense.</li>
    <li class="fragment">A legal system (courts, prisons, etc.).</li>
    <li class="fragment">Clean air and water.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fragment">Although these things are important, without
    government taxes and regulations, it would be easy for people to
    be <i>free riders</i>: to avoid doing their part to ensure these
    public goods were available.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Problem of Externalities</h2>

<audio controls data-autoplay data-timepoints="12,23,38" preload="metadata">
<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/extern.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/extern.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

<p>The actions of individuals (or groups, like businesses) may have
  consequences that affect others.</p>

<p class=fragment>If individuals or groups don't pay the costs of
  these consequences for others (or get extra compensation for the
  benefits from them), they are called <i>externalities</i>.

  </p><ul>
    <li class="fragment">Example of <i>negative</i> externality:
    pollution.</li>

      <!-- Georgia Power burns coal to
      produce electricity. It pays to run the power plant and buy the
      coal to fuel it, and receives money from people and business who
      buy electricity, but in the absence of government regulation the
      costs of the consequences of burning coal on the atmosphere (soot,
      sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, etc.) would be borne by others. -->

    <li class="fragment">Example of <i>positive</i> externality:
    vaccination.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Market Power and Monopolies</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/mktpower.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Under free market competition, consumers normally benefit from
    competition between producers and businesses to lower prices.</p>

  <p class="fragment">However, if one company controls all or most of a
  market, they can force consumers to pay higher prices or provide
    lesser quality of service.</p>

  <p class="fragment">For example, compare cell phones (where
  competition between several major companies leads to lower prices)
  to home Internet service (where only 1 or 2 companies offer service
  to most people).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Problem of Equity</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/equity.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/equity.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>A capitalist economic system may not lead to outcomes that are
  seen as ‚Äúfair,‚Äù particularly for people who cannot
    afford things that are seen as basic necessities.</p>
  <p class=fragment>In these cases,
  government steps in to ensure access to these things to
  everyone. Examples include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Food and shelter.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Elementary and secondary education.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Basic health care.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="fragment">Prices of other goods, like water and electricity,
  may be also be regulated to ensure everyone can afford them.</p>

  <h2>Forms of Government</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/formsgov.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Many governments today, and most throughout history, are based on
    an <b>authoritarian</b> system, where the ruler or ruling class
    has few constraints on their power but allow ordinary individuals
    some degree of personal freedom. Some <i>monarchies</i> today are
    examples of authoritarian states.

  <p class=fragment>In the 20th century, technology
  made <b>totalitarian</b> rule possible; Nazi Germany and North Korea
  are good examples, where government seeks to control all aspects of
  citizens' lives.

  <p class=fragment>On the other hand, in <b>democracies</b>, the people have a
    significant role in politics and government.

  <p class=fragment>This role is often
    guaranteed through <b>constitutional government</b>, a system
    that places limitations on the powers of government and politicians.

  <h2>Direct vs. Representative Democracy</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/directrep.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>At the time of the American revolution, many leaders were
        deeply skeptical of unchecked democracy, which they believed
        would lead to ‚ÄúKing Numbers‚Äù and <i>tyranny of the
        majority</i>.</p></li>

    <li class="fragment"><p>Even today, America relies mostly
        on <i>representative democracy</i>: citizens choose leaders to
        govern on their behalf between elections.</p></li>
    
    <li class="fragment"><p><i>Direct democracy</i>, including
        the <i>referendum</i> and <i>initiative</i>, tends to be used more
        frequently at the state and local level, but not at the national
        level.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Elitism vs. Pluralism</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/eliteplural.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"></source>
<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/eliteplural.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Even though the United States is a representative democracy, some
    people have more influence than others.

  <p class=fragment><i>Elitist theory</i> argues that a relatively
    small share of the population not only controls the bulk of
    America's wealth, but also holds virtually all of the political
    power as well.

  <p class=fragment>On the other hand, <i>pluralists</i> believe that
    while America does have elites, they do not control the
    government. Instead, power is distributed among thousands of
    organized <i>interest groups</i> of citizens which compete with
    each other for influence.

</audio>

  <h2>Declining Civic Engagement</h2>

  <p>Some political scientists believe Americans have become less
    engaged in society than in the past.

  <p class=fragment>This may lead to a loss of <i>social capital</i>
    which may discourage people from being involved in government and
    politics, leading to lower <i>political efficacy</i>.

  <p class=fragment>Our system relies on people who are willing and
    able to participate to solve problems in our society.

    <img alt="Petition to pardon Edward Snowden." src="img/intro-citgov/640px-Whitehouse_pardon_Edward_Snowden_petition.png" style="float: right; width: 40%"/></a>

  <p>There are numerous ways for people to involve themselves in
    politics:

    <ul>
      <li class=fragment>Voting, particularly in state and local
        elections with lower turnout.

      <li class=fragment>Attending political rallies.

      <li class=fragment>Donating money to, volunteering for political
        campaigns.

        <li class=fragment>Signing petitions.
    </ul>

  <p class=fragment>More radical forms of participation
    include <i>direct action</i> such as protests, boycotts, and civil
    disobedience.

  <h2>Youth Engagement</h2>

<source data-src="audio/intro-engage/youtheng.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
</audio>

  <p>Young people are less likely than older Americans to engage in
    various forms of political activity, particularly traditional
    political organizations.

  <p class=fragment>Many younger people may not feel connected to
    either of the major political parties and think supporting minor
    parties is pointless.

  <p class=fragment>Others may think parties don't care about issues
    important to them, or may think parties are out of step with their
    views on the issues.

  <p class=fragment>College students may also face greater challenges
    registering to vote and casting a ballot.
